# What Would Waga Do?

Find matches of high skilled players in a specific kind of matchup.

## Description

Stuck as TA vs MK for the fourth time in a row? Worry not - this mini site will help you watch matches of skilled players in any matchup you describe.
After a matchup is specified (your hero + opposing hero + lane), your hero's [most skilled players](https://www.opendota.com/heroes/46/rankings) are pulled from OpenDota, then each player is queried for a match where they played against the chosen opposing hero in the specified lane. The matches' IDs are printed, so you can watch these in-game and analyze the matchup.
